### Day 3: January 22, 2022
Today's Progress: I finally hosted the site on netlify, it works great, I created a twitter-bot-api but still have issues getting it to work but will try tomorrow

### Day 4: January 23, 2022
Today's Progress: Done with all I needed to do for this project, you can tweet the quoptes easily, implemented animation, done hosting and ready for the next project. Perhaps something bigger this time. Turns out I dont need a twitter bot api for this

Thoughts: I know spent some time on this, more than I expected but I had to deal with using onscreen keyboard for a while but I fixed the keyboard issue so I should be faster now but its all done.

### Day 5: January 24, 2022
Today's Progress: Started a new project from Free code camp frontend projects. The markdown review. The goal is to be able to type some code on an Editor div that will get instantly displayed on a preview div. So far, I am done with the Styling. Tommorrow to get it fully functional.

Thoughts: I am thinking nothing is impossible to accomplish if you know what you want.


### Day 6: January 25, 2022
Today's Progress: Finished the mark down preview with React and deployed

Thoughts:  Ready for another project.
